# Test the coder
## Programming test for software and robotics engineer candidates at General Interfaces GmbH

### Task:
Write a ROS node that calculates the moving maximum (running maximum) over 1000 samples in (soft) realtime of an incoming stream of Uint64s.
Publish your result after processing the incoming number and in addition forward the incoming number to the verifying node.

Add documentation and further adjustments as you see fit.

A rough guide to getting started can be found below.

Have fun and good Success.

####Requirements
